\chapter{Python Variables and Data Types}
A Variable is a mathematical object whose value might change. For example, $x=3$. In this statement, $x$ is the \textit{variable} and 3 is it's \textit{value}. Python has several data types and these values could be any of them. For example \textbf{'Hello world'} is a \textit{string}. If you are not sure what type the values are, you could use type().
