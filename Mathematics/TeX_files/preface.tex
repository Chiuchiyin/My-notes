\chapter{Preface}
I used to blog about mathematics and is planning to revive the work on Medium. Sadly, Medium lack support for LaTex and it is terribly hard to type equations without scratching my head looking for Unicode characters. The easiest solution is not use Medium but Wordpress with LaTex plug-in, like \href{https://terrytao.wordpress.com/}{Prof. Tao's blog}. However, I was also advised to use Medium as it is increasingly popular platform. So I will just type my piece here and put them on medium later, with equations added as images.
