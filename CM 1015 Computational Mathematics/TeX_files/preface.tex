\chapter{Preface}
I wrote this note after finishing the course so the content might not reflect the current version of the course. I personally feel this course should be called "Foundation Mathematics" instead of "Computational Mathematics" because of the lack of "Numerical Methods" and probably some other things people more familiar with the topic would say. I'm doing this as LaTeX practice. If you spot any error please don't hesitate to contact me via slack or mail me.
